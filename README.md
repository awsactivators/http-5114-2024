# http-5114-2024 - Workshop in Web Development Course


This course will allow students to access additional support for content delivered in the other classes each semester. Every student in the class will engage in a process of self-assessment to help them identify areas where they would benefit from help, and then the student and teaching team will set up a process for providing support for any areas where the student would benefit from some in-the-moment support. Mentors, tutors and workshops will be available.

> **Note:** Creating complex database-driven websites is a relatively new skill. In order to work in a continuously evolving industry, the web developer needs to develop strategies for life-long learning. This is a reflective process into self-directed learning and the mental models of Web development. Students will explore their own development practices and mental models as they learn how to build complex Web applications. Working in student teams, the students will meet with faculty weekly to discuss their progress
